After diving into a full year's worth of sales data for our pizzeria, I conducted an end-to-end Pizza Sales Analysis, transforming raw numbers into actionable insights. Here’s what I uncovered using Power BI:

🔍 Data Preparation:

Extracted and transformed order dates into readable formats like day name, hour, and month.

Assigned numerical values to days of the week to identify trends.

Standardized pizza size labels (L → Large, M → Medium, etc.) for clarity.

📈 Key Metrics (via custom DAX measures):

Total Revenue: $817.86K

Total Pizzas Sold: 49,574

Total Orders: 21,350

Avg. Pizzas per Order: 2.32

Avg. Order Value: $38.31
